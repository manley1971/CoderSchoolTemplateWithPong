        My Childhood
      </summary>

      <p>I lived in the same Indiana city where Michael Jackson grew up. My family moved aroud a bunch, but after attending Stanford, I haven't left the California Bay Area. I am married with two kids. They are both pretty great at math and are good at programming, too. One enjoys arts and crafts, one likes to crunch numbers. I mean, if the numbers are of interest to them in the first place.</p>
